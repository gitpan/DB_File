# 1. Where is the file db.h?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where dh.h is
#    installed on your system.

INCLUDE	= /usr/local/include

# 2. Where is libdb?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where libdb is
#    installed on your system.

LIB	= /usr/local/lib

# 3. What version of Berkely DB have you got?
#
#    This module does NOT support Berkeley DB 2.0 (or greater).
#
#    If you have a recent copy of Berkeley DB (1.78 or greater) you
#    shouldn't have to change the definitions for PREFIX and HASH
#    below.
#
#    For older versions of Berkeley DB change both PREFIX and HASH to int.
#    Version 1.71, 1.72 and 1.73 are known to need this change.
#
#    If you don't know what version you have have a look in the file db.h. 
#
#    Search for the string "DB_VERSION_MAJOR". If it is present, you
#    have Berkeley DB version 2 (or greater). This module does not support 
#    it.
#
#    First, find the definition of the BTREEINFO typedef. Check the
#    return type from the prefix element. It should look like this in an
#    older copy of db.h:
#
#        int      (*prefix)      __P((const DBT *, const DBT *));  
#
#    and like this in a more recent copy:
#
#        size_t  (*prefix)       /* prefix function */
#            __P((const DBT *, const DBT *));
#
#    Change the definition of PREFIX, below, to reflect the return type
#    of the prefix function in your db.h.
#
#    Now find the definition of the HASHINFO typedef. Check the return
#    type of the hash element. Older versions look like this:
#
#        int      (*hash) __P((const void *, size_t));      
#
#    newer like this:
#
#        u_int32_t               /* hash function */
#                (*hash) __P((const void *, size_t));
#
#    Change the definition of HASH, below, to reflect the return type of
#    the hash function in your db.h.
#

PREFIX	=	size_t
HASH	=	u_int32_t

# end of file CONFIG
